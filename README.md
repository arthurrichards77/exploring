WARNING: code is incomplete compared to papers, as it is not the most recent version.

Exploring simulation combines reinforcement learning with model predictive control, as reported in https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2013-4790 and later https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-019-09829-4

The "convexify" subdirectory contains the core utility for determining a convex navigable region using simulated annealing, as reported in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8206035.  This has not been integrated with the MPC here.
